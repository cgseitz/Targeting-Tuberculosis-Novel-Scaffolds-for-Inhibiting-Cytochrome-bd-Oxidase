1) the structures here came from /net/jam-amaro-shared/bd_oxidase/ecoli/prod/protein.prmtop and from /net/jam-amaro-shared/bd_oxidase/ecoli/prod/q_loop/reps.nc, from Shirley's email on 4/10/22.
we picked the top four clusters since the number of frames decreases after that. I saved out as a pdb the first four frames from the reps.nc; maestro incorrectly recognizes two waters as solvent. Neither of these are in the q loop so I deleted them. I also deleted the ligands since we don't want those interfering with the q loop docking.

2)  Shirley already ran these through GaMD but I still need to do a small protein prep for Maestro to accept them. I used the protein preparation workflow
preprocess
cap termini
fill in missing side chains
assign bond orders using CCD database
create zero order bonds to metals
create disulfide bonds
fill in missing loops using prime
generate het states with epik using pH 7.4 +- 2.0

I did not optimize h bond assignments or clean up the structure as I did not want to change the structures that Shirley generated. After running this workflow, it still recognized the iron in HB1 as a ligand, so I removed that iron. HB1 is not in the q loop so it wouldn't participate in docking anyways, so this is fine.

3) The residues 258-390 encompass the q loop. I created the box for ligand docking through tasks -> receptor grid generation
site -> centroid of selected residues
from here I selected residues 258 - 390, and this gave the center of the box coordinates as
x, y, z 53.31, 62.33, 55.55
to have the box better encompass the q loop, I changed these to
x, y, z 53.31, 59.33, 55.55

and then size -> dock ligands with length <= 18 A
advanced settings
box length in X: 40 A
box length in Y: 40 A
box length in Z: 28 A

for cluster 2, the final coordinates after subtracting 3 A from the y coordinate were
x, y, z 53.37, 59.91, 56.23

for cluster 3, the final coordinates after subtracting 3 A from the y coordinate were
x, y, z 53.28, 59.12, 55.04

for cluster 4, the final coordinates after subtracting 3 A from the y coordinate were
x, y, z 54.24 59.15 55.11

I then saved the prepared protein structure as cluster1_maestro.pdb for use in docking.

4) I then uploaded these to hopper to run with the Enamine and Life Chemicals libraries

5) the oxygen channel structures came from /net/jam-amaro-shared/bd_oxidase/ecoli/prod/oxygen_channel/oxygen_channel.pdb
and the uq8 structures came from /net/jam-amaro-shared/bd_oxidase/ecoli/prod/uq8_binding/uq8_binding.pdb

6) I did another protein prep, the same as in step 2) for each
- for the oxygen channel structures, I need to delete all the solvent and ligands except for the heme d and its associated prn, as these form the end of the oxygen channel. then I also need to fill in the missing side chains and loops, but not generate het states or cap termini as I think maestro doesn't know how to handle a heme
- for the uq8, I deleted the solvent, fatty acids, and hemes, and left the uq8.
7) The residues 107, 606, 609, 898 (i.e. vmd resid 107 etc) approximate the e coli oxygen channel. These correspond to Glu99.A, Trp63.B, Thr66.B, Thr355.B in the paper. To better encompass the oxygen channel, I made the box length in x, y and z be 20, 20, 20 
for the uq8 receptor grid generation, I picked the ligand to make sure it is excluded from the docking results, and also made that the center of the bounding box, selecting ligands of similar size to uq8

8) From the HTVS, selected the top 20,000 poses for SP docking. Note, I am not selecting the top 20,000 unique ligands, just the top 20,000 poses.

9) From the SP, selected the top 1,000 poses for XP docking. Note, I am not selecting the top 1,000 unique ligands, just the top 1,000 poses.
$SCHRODINGER/utilities/glide_sort -o glide-dock_SP_1000.maegz glide-dock_sp_pv.maegz -norecep -use_dscore -n 1000

$SCHRODINGER/utilities/glide_sort -o htvs_dscore.maegz -r htvs_dscore.txt glide-dock_HTVS_1_pv.maegz -best_by_title -norecep -use_dscore

10) From the XP, selected the top 50 poses. Here, I am selecting the top 50 unique ligands.
$SCHRODINGER/utilities/glide_sort -o glide-dock_XP_50.maegz -r report.txt glide-dock_xp_pv.maegz -norecep -use_dscore -best -n 50

11) for Andy/Kurt for ecoli, I need to come up with 100 molecules total across the different libraries and docking runs. This will mean I will take 50 molecules from enamine and 50 from life chemicals. There are nine pockets total. This means I will request the top 7 molecules from each library for each site, totaling 63 molecules from each library because some molecules may not be available. I will extract these with this command:
$SCHRODINGER/utilities/glide_sort -o glide-dock_XP_7.maegz -r report.txt glide-dock_xp_pv.maegz -norecep -use_dscore -best -n 7

19) for Andy/Kurt for Mtb, I need to come up with 100 molecules total across the different libraries and docking runs. This will mean I will take 50 molecules from enamine and 50 from life chemicals. There are twenty four pockets total. This means I will request the top 3 molecules from each library for each site, totaling 72 molecules from each library because some molecules may not be available. I will extract these with this command:
$SCHRODINGER/utilities/glide_sort -o glide-dock_XP_3.maegz -r report.txt glide-dock_xp_pv.maegz -norecep -use_dscore -best -n 3
